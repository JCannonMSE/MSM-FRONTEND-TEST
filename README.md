# Full Stack Developer test

> We have a simple [Bitcoin exchange API](https://blockchain.info/ticker) we would like you to build a proxy that sorts the returned values by currency name (Backend) and then a UI that displays these values on a web page.
> To run the application you can run the TestApplication.java file or run ./gradlew bootRun from the command line

## Task 1

* Using the code examples provided finish the service and it's tests so that the tests pass and the information available can be obtained from a reasonable URL.

## Task 2
> The starting page is available at http://localhost:8080/index.html

*  Using Javascript GET the ticker information back from the endpoint constructed in task 1 and in an organised way present this information back in browser using Semantic HTML, it is expected that you will also style your markup, the look and feel is left for you, although basic responsiveness is expected.  For the purpose of this exercise the script/styles should work in the latest copy of Chrome

*  This information changes every few seconds, please build in a mechanism for updating and displaying the latest available information.
